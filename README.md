### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### NOTE: I own two github accounts of which this was my first. I changed the username of my active github account(github.com/hisyntax) to [github.com/iqquee](https://github.com/iqquee) and i still which to retain the username hisyntax and as such I assigned it to the pervious github account as a means to serve as a redirect to my origin account (prevoiusly github.com/hisyntax) which is now renamed to github.com/iqquee.
